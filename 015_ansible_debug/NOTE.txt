Ansible set_fact doesn't change the variable value
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27038553/ansible-set-fact-doesnt-change-the-variable-value


The set_fact module effectively adds another host fact, ie. "a fact discovered
about the system". From the documentation
(http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)
you can see that those facts have low priority, and will be overridden by
extra-vars and various other things.

This can be confusing because using set_fact can make it seem like you are
changing the value of the variable at that point, but maybe the name is the key
to understanding - it's not 'set_variable', it's 'set_(host)fact', and host
facts have low precedence. Precedence is more important than the order in which
the value is assigned.

One workaround if you want to supply a value via extra-vars that gets
overwritten later would be to reassign that extra-vars value to a different
variable via set_fact at the start of your playbook, and then reassign that new
variable later using set_fact again. Since they're at the same precedence
level, the 'overwrite' should work as you would expect.
